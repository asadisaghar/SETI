# SETI
- see https://github.com/koffol/SETI/issues/1 for best suggested parameter combination
- tools.py and vis.py need to be in the same dir as SETI.py (the main body)
- run SETI.py with desired parameters. This dumps the multi-D "galaxy" array into a file at certain frequencies set by either dt_log or colonization_fraction
- vis.py is to visualize the array using different modes of plot_part_gal function
